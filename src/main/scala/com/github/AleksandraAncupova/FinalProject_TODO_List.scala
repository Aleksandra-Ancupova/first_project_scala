     // set up connection to database when we run application, new folder in resources is created and inside is database todo.db
    // connect DBeaver to this database, then all entries are written there
    // ask user for tasks, write it one by one

    // table tasks should have columns id, Task, Created, Status, Finished ? maybe priority?
    // another table could have statuses: id, Started, In Progress, Done
    // maybe account for several users? then each user has separate table of tasks

    // App can ask you smth like:
    // Would you like to add a task or update status?
    // Which task would you like to add to your TODO list?
    // Another?
    // Update status?


    // maybe then create method to get some stats on completed tasks, etc?
